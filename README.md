# selenium_python_pytest


The intention of this repository is to create automation testing with POM with Selenium, Python and Pytest for Youtube
app.


Why Selenium, Python and Pytest?
Even though I am pro Cypress for its quicker setup, readability, great documentation, easy access, and great community
I have found out that big companies use these technologies: Selenium, Python and Pytest, I think is mainly because 
Selenium offers diversity in terms of programming language. 

Why POM?
Page Object Model(POM) is a design pattern that allows better scalability of the test framework
it also prevents duplication of selector, as selectors are stored separately which allows easiest access to Engineers. 

What does this repo encompass?
- Automation testing with Selenium, Python, Pytest
- CI/CD for GitHub actions, and potentially AWS Codebuild
- Reporting
- Slack notifications
