# ‚òïÔ∏è Automation Testing: `selenium_python_pytest` 
The intention of this repository is to create automation testing with POM with Selenium, Python and Pytest for Youtube 
app. 


## **Why Selenium, Python and Pytest?**
Even though I am pro Cypress for its quicker setup, readability, great documentation, easy access, and great community
I have found out that big companies use Selenium, Python and Pytest, I think is mainly because 
Selenium offers diversity in terms of programming language. The idea of this repo is to expand my knowledge on Selenium 
and Python; I am also have a lot of fun doing it, and I will be using this models to write medium articles. 

_Stay tuned, as the same will occur with Playwright and Appium._ ü§ì


##### ‚ÅâÔ∏è Why POM?
Page Object Model(POM) is a design pattern that allows better scalability of the test framework
it also prevents duplication of selector, as selectors are stored separately which allows easiest access to Engineers. 

##### ‚ÅâÔ∏è What does this repo encompass?
- Automation testing with Selenium, Python, Pytest with Youtube app
- CI/CD for GitHub actions, and potentially AWS Codebuild
- Reporting
- Slack notifications
